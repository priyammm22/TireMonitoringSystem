# Tire Monitoring System

## Project Overview
The **Tire Monitoring System** is designed to help vehicle owners maintain tire health, improve driving safety, and reduce environmental impact caused by tire degradation. Using **IoT sensors**, the system collects real-time data on tire degradation and driving patterns, and processes this information with **AI/ML models** to provide:

- **Driving pattern classification** (Smooth, Moderate, Aggressive)
- **Tire degradation prediction** and remaining life estimation
- **Personalized driving recommendations** for safer, eco-friendly driving

## Features
- **Real-time tire health monitoring** through IoT sensors
- **AI-powered analysis** to classify driving patterns and predict tire life
- **Personalized driving recommendations** to reduce tire wear and microplastic emissions
- **Sustainability** and **safety** enhancements through intelligent feedback

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for AI/ML model development)
- **Flask** (for backend API)
- **TensorFlow** (for driving pattern detection)
- **Joblib** (for tire life prediction model)
- **IoT Sensors** (to collect tire degradation data)
- **Git** and **GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)
- **NodeJs** and **expressJs** (for managing entire proccess)
- **Mongodb** (for storing user/car information)
- **HMTL CSS JS** (for frontend)
